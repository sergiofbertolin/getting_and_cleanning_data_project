# Getting_and_cleanning_data_project
Course project

Within this repository we have included some different files:

##README.md 
With the inclussion of this file we try to give some guidelines to correct intrerpretting and using every file included on the repository  

##CodeBook.md
References and explanations to understand the meaning, units and particularities of the variables of the obtained data set by the execution of "run_analysis.R". The tidy dataset is automatically generated by the execution of the source code and saved into your current working directory with the name "out.txt"

##run_analysis.R

Important!! To the correct running of this source code you have to place the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder in the working directory. The R script take the raw observations and measures and implements the following steps (comments on the steps are included on the scrip too):

-Firstly, extracts the whole variables included on the different files 

-Initially only merge the data of train and test file "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt", respectively 

-Then, we create a new data_frame which stores only the variables related with mean and standard deviation measuremnts. The variables with FreqMean are not condidered by us, cause we have considered that the mentioned ones are not a mean of measurements or observations. The selected variables, extracted from "features.txt" sums up to 63, as listed below:

1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X

2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y

-After that, we included a column with the activity, extracted from "y_test.txt" and "y_train.txt" and we replaced the number corresponding to the activity by a easy-readable name, as they are listed on the "activiy_labels.txt" file:

1 -> WALKING

2 -> WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 -> WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 -> SITTING

5 -> STANDING

6 -> LAYING
